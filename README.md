## Welcome to Gone Fishin'

This is a simple arcade game to help me learn development using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

To run the game you only need to have a recent [Rust version installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), this was built with 0.10.

And then just run `cargo run` from the root of this repo.

## Gameplay
Move your player back and forth using the arrow keys.

Press `Space` to drop your bomb and again to detonate it.

You want to kill the orange fish, but don't hit the protected turtles (green fish) or you'll lose!

Walk over to and press `A` to collect your fish that have floated to the surface after being hit with a bomb to get your points.

You can pause the game with `Escape`.
